Project Management

## Description

The purpose of the tool is to aid users in tracking one or more projects by tasks and breaking down a complex project into different levels of subtasks.

## Key Features

* Create and manage workspaces, lists, folders, statuses and tasks
* Track tasks through customizable statuses (e.g. To-do, In progress)
* Adding dependencies to the tasks (e.g. assignees, deadline, notes)
* List view
* User authentication and authorization
* Session management for users

## Lessons Learned

* Throughout the project, we have learned that working on a team is not-at-all an easy endeavor. We have also learned there are tools to leverage, especially in the 21st century, for working with individuals other than ourselves. Yet, team collaboration is an art of trying to balance what we need, what our team members need, and the features (and end product) we are trying to build. So everyone on the team (Group 4) had to put in the effort and demand required of us to successfully deliver the features we each have taken up responsibility for.
* In terms of technology, there are a lot of tools we were not familiar with at the beginning of the project. And there is still so much more to learn in terms of Spring and what it has to offer. Also, we found out that in the department of building user interfaces, we have room for improvement and a plethora of tools at our disposal to use.
* The project can also be improved and is reflecting on the areas that we are both good and still weak in.
